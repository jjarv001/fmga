            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are a group of mushroom producers residing in the Middle Peninsula of Virginia. The vast majority of our products come from
                mushrooms grown from logs and stumps. We are a small group of people who are passionate about mushrooms and want to share our
                knowledge with others.
            <p>
            </p>
                Mushrooms (and the mycelium beneath) are a vital part of the ecosystem. Luckily for us, they are also delicious and nutritious!
                Our goal is to provide a nutritious, delicious, and planet-friendly product to our customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also encourage and educate our customers in methods of mushroom cultivation. As a co-op, we work to develop training materials,
                instructions/tutorials, and recipes for our customers to use on their own. 
            </p>
            <p>
                FMGA is a group of people who are passionate about the outdoors, our fungi friends, and the future of our planet.
                Please join us in our mission to "Inoculate the World"!
