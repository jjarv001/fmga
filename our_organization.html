            <h1><u>Our Organization - FMGA</u></h1>

            <h2><u>Our Co-op</u></h2>
            
            <p>We are a group of mushroom producers residing in the Middle Peninsula of Virginia. The vast majority of our products come from
                mushrooms grown from logs and stumps. We are a co-op of mushroom producers, and we work together to provide our customers with
                the best possible products. Our goal is to provide our customers with the freshest, most delicious mushrooms possible, while also
                supporting sustainable and environmentally friendly practices.
            </p>
            

            <h2><u>Our Products</u></h2>
            <p>
                We offer a variety of mushroom products, including fresh mushrooms, dried mushrooms, mushroom powders, and various other 
                mushroom-based products. Our mushrooms and mushroom products are primarily sourced from hand-inoculated logs and stumps. 
                While many commercial mushroom producers use climate-controlled environments to grow their mushrooms, we work around the 
                natural seasons and conditions of the Middle Peninsula. This means that our mushrooms are grown in a more natural and
                sustainable way.
            </p>
            

            
            <h2><u>Our Services</u></h2>
                <p>
                    As a group, we work together to develop training and educational materials for our members and the public. We also offer workshops
                    and events to help people learn more about mushrooms and how to grow them. Our goal is to provide our customers with the tools 
                    and knowledge to succeed in their own. We believe our environmentally friendly practices and sustainable methods
                    are the best way to ensure a healthy and sustainable future for our planet.
    
                    Additionally, we are currently considering consulting services for those interested in starting their own mushroom farm, whether it
                    be a small backyard operation or a larger commercial venture. Feel free to contact us for more information!
                </p>
